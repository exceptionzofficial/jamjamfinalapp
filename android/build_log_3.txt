WARNING: The specified Android SDK Build Tools version (27.0.3) is ignored, as it is below the minimum supported version (35.0.0) for Android Gradle Plugin 8.12.0.
Android SDK Build Tools 35.0.0 will be used.
To suppress this warning, remove "buildToolsVersion '27.0.3'" from your build.gradle file, as each version of the Android Gradle Plugin now has a default version of the build tools.

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 10.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.
